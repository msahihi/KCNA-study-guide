# KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate) - Study Guide

> **Note**: This is a personal study guide created to help organize learning materials and facilitate passing the KCNA certification. It is not an official CNCF or Linux Foundation resource, but rather a structured collection of study materials, labs, and notes compiled from various sources.

## Overview

The Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA) is an entry-level certification that demonstrates a learner's understanding of Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies. This certification validates knowledge of cloud-native fundamentals, including container orchestration with Kubernetes, cloud-native architecture, and the CNCF ecosystem.

**Who Should Take KCNA**:
- Beginners entering the cloud-native field
- Professionals seeking foundational Kubernetes knowledge
- Anyone preparing for more advanced CNCF certifications (CKAD, CKA)

**About This Guide**:
This repository is a personal effort to create organized, easily accessible content to support KCNA exam preparation. It consolidates information from official documentation, community resources, and hands-on practice into a structured learning path.
